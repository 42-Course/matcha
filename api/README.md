> The only thing better than a Matcha latte is sharing one with **a new friend**.  
> This is a fully-documented, TDD-driven Sinatra API for **Matcha, a platform for meeting friends** — not dating. It’s modular, dockerized, and built for good conversations that start slow 🤝

---

## 🤝 What Matcha is (and isn't)

Matcha is for **finding and keeping friends** — people to meet up with, not romance.
The whole product is tuned to make interactions calm and intentional:

### 📬 Message rules (enforced by the API)

- You can only message someone you're **already connected with** (a mutual friend).
- Messages are **at most 300 characters**.
- You may send **one message per friend, per calendar day** — no more. After you
  send one, you can message that same friend again the next day. This keeps
  conversations thoughtful instead of spammy.

A second message to the same friend on the same day returns
`429 Daily message limit reached`. See `MessagesController` and
`Message.sent_today?` for the implementation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

---

### 📘 Postman Collection

> Visit the [Postman Colleciton](https://pulgamecanica.postman.co/workspace/pulgamecanica~fddcef76-1724-4c9d-8f90-c24cfe79c2b9/collection/13231501-422c8247-c0ee-4bec-834b-ede0215c4e05?action=share&creator=13231501) to run all the API endpoints.

---

### 🔧 Local Dev (Dockerized)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pulgamecanica/matcha
cd matcha

# Build containers
make build
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

RSpec tests live in `spec/`, with:
- Integration tests for endpoints
- Unit tests for helpers
- Full TDD on auth, validation, sessions, and core models

```bash
make test
```

---

## 🛠️ Developer Shortcuts (Makefile)

```bash
make create   # db:create
make migrate  # db:migrate
make seed     # db:seed
make test     # run all specs (you can provide a file)
make console  # open IRB console
make logs     # see the docker logs
make docs     # export route documentation
make re_db    # recreate database (empty)
make seed     # generate database and seed data
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication

Stateless JWT (no libraries!) via `SessionToken`.

```rb
SessionToken.generate(user_id)  # => "encoded.jwt.token"
SessionToken.decode(token)      # => { "user_id" => 42, ... }
```

---

## 📘 API Documentation

Each route is documented inline with the `api_doc` DSL.  
To export to markdown:

```bash
make docs
```

➡ Output: `docs/exported.md`

Example:

```ruby
api_doc "/auth/register", method: :post do
  description "Register a new user"
  param :email, String, required: true
  param :username, String, required: true
  param :password, String, required: true
  response 201, "User created"
end
```
